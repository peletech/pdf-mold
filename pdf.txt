Findings and General Recommendations
•

•
•

Dehumidification - It is recommended to install a dehumidifier in the apartment
to maintain humidity levels between 30%-60%.
Bathrooms, Tiles and Walls - Cracks in grouting should be quickly repaired
with waterproof caulking. Mold is often found in bathrooms where ventilation is a
concern. It is essential that proper ventilation be maintained in all bathrooms.
Storage - Avoid Storage of fibrous materials, cardboard or any other organic
material in damp locations. Use plastic containers.
Pipes/Plumbing - Always monitor moisture from 'sweating' pipes. Pipes that
display dripping should be insulated at once.
